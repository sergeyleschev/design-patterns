// Create piles of money and link them together 10 < 20 < 50 < 100.**
let ten = MoneyPile(value: 10, quantity: 6, next: nil)
let twenty = MoneyPile(value: 20, quantity: 2, next: ten)
let fifty = MoneyPile(value: 50, quantity: 2, next: twenty)
let hundred = MoneyPile(value: 100, quantity: 1, next: fifty)

// Build ATM.
var atm = ATM(hundred: hundred, fifty: fifty, twenty: twenty, ten: ten)
atm.withdraw(amount: 310) // Cannot because ATM has only 300
atm.withdraw(amount: 100) // Can withdraw - 1x100
